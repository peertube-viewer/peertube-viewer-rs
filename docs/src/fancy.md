Fancy features
==============

**peertube-viewer** comes with a bunch of fancy but not really necessary features:

- **autocompletion** the build systems automatically creates autocompletion for a few shells, available in `./completions`
- **preloading** peertube-viewer-rs is capable of preloading some info in advance. For example when typing `:n`, the search happens before you type `ENTER`, the same happens for video information when typing a video id. This makes **peertube-viewer-rs** much snappier.
